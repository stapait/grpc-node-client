# grpc-node-server
A gRPC client written in Node.js to talk with our Golang Server

The purpose is to benchmark how many requests client can make to server considering REST and gRPC as protocols.

There are two applications: one server written in Go (golang-grpc-server) and other written in Node.js (node-grpc-client).

Get both from repositories so they can talk with each other and you can get some benchmarks.
